  <h1>About Us</h1>

  <p>We are Bearcat Cafe! We are a caf√© for visitors to come enjoy fresh, healthy food in a friendly environment. 
  We are a place to meet and eat while enjoying the best ingredients Charlotte, North Carolina has to offer.
  You can enjoy a cup of the best freshly roasted coffee that we recieve from Counter Culture along with our menu items. 
  Ingredients from our menu come from local bakeries and gardens around the Charlotte area that you know and love. After enjoying a meal or a 
  good chat with your friends, take a walk in our Gabs Bamboo Garden where you can enjoy the view of our beautiful animals! We have Birds, Pandas,
  Koalas, and more that you can view and see them hang around the garden. Stop by now and enjoy the view!</p>
